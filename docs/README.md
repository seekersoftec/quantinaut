**Quantinaut** is a powerful module designed to automate the process of training and deploying predictive machine learning models within the [Nautilus Trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/) ecosystem. By leveraging advanced AI techniques, Quantinaut empowers users to make data-driven trading decisions with greater precision and efficiency.

**Key Features:**

- **Self-Adaptive Learning:** Continuously retrains models in real-time to adapt to evolving market conditions, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Rapid Feature Engineering:** Automatically generates a vast array of relevant features from user-defined strategies, providing a rich dataset for model training.
- **High-Performance Inference:** Executes model predictions efficiently, even with complex models, to facilitate timely trading decisions.
- **Realistic Backtesting:** Simulates real-world conditions by incorporating self-adaptive retraining into the backtesting process.
- **Flexible Framework:** Supports a wide range of machine learning algorithms and libraries, enabling users to experiment with different approaches.
- **Robust Data Handling:** Implements advanced techniques for outlier detection, data normalization, and missing value imputation, ensuring data quality.
- **Efficient Data Management:** Automatically cleans and preprocesses historical data, streamlining the data preparation process.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduces the complexity of the feature space, improving model performance and reducing computational costs.

**Quantinaut is inspired by FreqAI**

## TODOs: 
- GUI: 
  ```text
    A comprehensive dashboard with the following tech stack: 
    vector.dev + VictoriaMetrics + VictoriaLogs +  Grafana.  

    - NT outputs logs to a file in logfmt format.

    - Vector parses the log files and writes the data to both VictoriaMetrics and VictoriaLogs.

    - Grafana is used for visualization and presentation.
